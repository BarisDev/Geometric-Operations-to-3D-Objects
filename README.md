# Geometric Operations to 3D Objects
 This code applies Rotate, Scale, Translate operations to 3D objects.
## Code Explanation
x, y, z are coordinate arrays for cube. t is needed for translations.<br>You can also change these coordinates for your shape.
```
x = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
y = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
z = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
t = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```
